# Carrotive

A Landing Page created as a fun exercise to showcase my CSS and HTML skills and progress. View [live page](https://haynesmatt.github.io/Landing-Page/).

This project helped me strengthen my knowledge and implimentation of Flexbox, along with other common CSS styling techniques. This also helped me learn how to take a blank HTML document and transform it into a designed website, piece by piece. 

This website is most suitable for desktops.
